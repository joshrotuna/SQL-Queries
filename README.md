* [Oracle SQL](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/sql.html) 

## Launch

**Skalia Database**

Download the skalia_schema.sql, skalia_data.sql, and skalia.sql files
In your SQL Client Software create a new database connection with a new database that contains the necessary files. Execute the codes contained in the .sql files (The skalia_data file will create a new database for you).

**Specialty Food Database**
Download the *Specialty_Food_Schema.sql* file. In your SQL Client Server, execute the code as is. This will create the necessary databases and insert the data required.
